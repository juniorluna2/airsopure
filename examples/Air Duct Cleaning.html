        <span class="how_do_heading" style="letter-spacing: 2px;line-height: 41px;">Is Air Duct Cleaning Worth It and What is Duct Cleaning?</span> <span class="how_do_text" style="text-align:justify;color:#002A52;"> Air ducts are the delivery system for a home or businesses heating and cooling system. Some call air ducts the lungs of a home because they are breathing air in and exhaling air out. They connect to the furnace or air conditioning system and transport the conditioned air to the living space or office space. Air ducts are made up a variety of materials. The most common material for air ducts is galvanized sheet metal. Other materials for air ducts could be flexible tubing called "flex ducts", fiber board duct or "insulated" or "lined" ductwork.<br/>
        <br/>
        A heating and cooling system for a home or business is designed to pull air from the occupied space and condition it to the desired temperature chosen by the thermostat. The way that almost all heating and cooling systems do this is by using air ducts. Air ducts will remove air from the living space by using a "return" duct and deliver the conditioned air once it goes through the furnace or air handling unit by the form of a "supply" duct. Many air duct systems can be made up of several hundred feet of ducting snaking through a home or business to do what they were designed to do, deliver air.<br/>

        <br/>
        Since air ducts are pulling air from the living space and heating or cooling that same air and delivering it back inside of a home or business, they are also sucking in any particulate or debris and pumping it back into that same space.  It is not uncommon for an air duct to accumulate several pounds of dirt and debris.  Debris can be made up of different types of things and not limited to Dead Skin Cells, Pet Dander, Construction Debris, Smoke Odor, Molds, Mildew, Outside Construction Debris, VOC's, Carpet Fibers, Pet Hair and many other things.  When these particulates enter the air ducts they may fully cycle through the air duct system or may stay lodged in the air ducts only to come lose months or years down the road.<br/>

        Air Duct Cleaning is the service of cleaning the inside surfaces of the air ducts and getting them back to their original state which is bare metal, fiber board or flex duct.  When air is passing through the air duct delivery system, it was designed to be free and clear of dirt and debris.  A proper air duct cleaning as stated by the National Air Duct Cleaners Association should accomplish "Total Source Removal".  What this means is that the debris inside of the air ducts should be completely removed and every piece of ducting whether heating duct or return duct should be cleaned.  To accomplish this you can use many equipment variations.<br/>
        <br/>
        The most common and most powerful equipment choice for Amistee Air Duct Cleaning is the vacuum truck used for air duct cleaning in Michigan.  This piece of highly specialized equipment is a self contained truck that is fully equipped with all of the proper tools to clean an air duct system.  The vacuum trucks that Amistee uses can range between 16,000-17,000 CFM in suction power.  The benefit of using a vacuum truck for air duct cleaning is that all of the dirt and debris gets pulled directly outside to a collection bin inside of the truck and the power is unbeatable.  In many cases, if the truck was more powerful it would crush most duct systems<br/>
        <br/>
        The other equipment choice for air duct cleaning would be to use a portable piece of equipment.  This is a piece of air duct cleaning equipment that is portable and can be moved inside of a home or business to perform an air duct cleaning.  Portable equipment is sometimes needed for large commercial buildings or high rise complexes.  The average CFM suction power can range from 2,000-5,000 for a well maintained clean piece of equipment.  An inferior dirty piece of equipment may be similar to a shop vac and should never be used for air duct cleaning.  Portable air duct cleaning equipment is by far the most common due to the low cost.  It is worth noting that not all portable equipment is the same but properly maintained portable vacuums designed for air duct cleaning can do the trick but they may lose a lot of their suction power once a cleaning begins because the filters may get dirty and clogged.  There is a range in quality and suction power of portable air duct cleaning equipment.  If you choose to have your air ducts cleaned by a company that you feel will provide the best value for your money, make sure that if portable equipment is used it is HEPA filtered.  The reason for this is that if there is not the proper filtration on the vacuum, when it is on and exhausting air into your home or business it could also be contaminating the air you breathe.  HEPA filters and stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Arresting or   High-Efficiency Particulate Air and can capture 99.97% of all debris   greater than .3 microns, will collect and catch almost all debris if   clean and maintained.<br/>
        <br/>
        When an air duct cleaning company comes to clean an air duct system it is important to remember that all pieces of the air delivery system (air ducts) must be cleaned to provide you with results.  Air duct systems can accumulate 20-30 pounds of debris that is being spewed into the living space when the furnace or air conditioner is running.  In many cases, after a proper air duct cleaning, our clients at Amistee  notice less dust indoor.If prior allergy or sinus problems were triggered while  being inside of the conditioned space reduced symptoms are noticed after an air  duct cleaning.<br/>
        <br/>
        Just like any industry, there are companies that will try and take advantage of consumers that are unaware of what to expect or what needs to be done for an air duct cleaning.  These unethical companies have been giving the air duct cleaning industry a bad name for many years and if I got my air ducts cleaned at my personal residence by one of these companies I too would think it is not worth the money.  The truth is, when done right air duct cleaning really works.  Air duct cleaning removes the debris from the interior surfaces which you will someday be breathing. When searching for an air duct cleaning company if the deal seems too good to be true, it usually is!  Maybe you are allergic to the debris or maybe you are not, this does not change the fact that the debris is there and you will be breathing it if not properly removed by a proper air duct cleaning.<br/>
        <br/>
        When choosing an air duct cleaning company to clean your air ducts, do  your research. The best way when choosing a company is to look at a companies  history with past clients and ask for recent jobs that have been done. If they  do good work, they are proud of the work they do and would be happy to have you  speak with recent customers. Do they have any complaints on the BBB? Ask the  potential company for referrals from past customers in your area or for  customers that have a similar air duct configurations if yours is unique. Check  the length of time the business has been cleaning air ducts. Is it an add on  service? Make sure the potential company is licensed and insured and ask to see  both of these (there is nothing wrong with asking, if they have both they will  easily provide them to you). Do other service companies refer the potential air  duct cleaner? If so, ask who and call them to see the history. You can tell a  lot about someone by their friends and the same goes for businesses. Lastly,  make sure the price they are quoting you will not change and if so why. Do not  fall victim to a &quot;bait and switch&quot; scam.)<br/>

Some call air ducts the lungs of a home because they are breathing air in and exhaling air out. They connect to the furnace or air conditioning system and transport the conditioned air to the living space or office space. Air ducts are made up a variety of materials. The most common material for air ducts is galvanized sheet metal. Other materials for air ducts could be flexible tubing called "flex ducts", fiber board duct or "insulated" or "lined" ductwork.<br/>

        Air Duct Cleaning is the service of cleaning the inside surfaces of the air ducts and getting them back to their original state which is bare metal, fiber board or flex duct.  When air is passing through the air duct delivery system, it was designed to be free and clear of dirt and debris.  A proper air duct cleaning as stated by the National Air Duct Cleaners Association should accomplish "Total Source Removal".  What this means is that the debris inside of the air ducts should be completely removed and every piece of ducting whether heating duct or return duct should be cleaned.  To accomplish this you can use many equipment variations.<br/>
        <br/>
        The most common and most powerful equipment choice for Amistee Air Duct Cleaning is the vacuum truck used for air duct cleaning in Michigan.  This piece of highly specialized equipment is a self contained truck that is fully equipped with all of the proper tools to clean an air duct system.  The vacuum trucks that Amistee uses can range between 16,000-17,000 CFM in suction power.  The benefit of using a vacuum truck for air duct cleaning is that all of the dirt and debris gets pulled directly outside to a collection bin inside of the truck and the power is unbeatable.  In many cases, if the truck was more powerful it would crush most duct systems<br/>
        <br/>
        The other equipment choice for air duct cleaning would be to use a portable piece of equipment.  This is a piece of air duct cleaning equipment that is portable and can be moved inside of a home or business to perform an air duct cleaning.  Portable equipment is sometimes needed for large commercial buildings or high rise complexes.  The average CFM suction power can range from 2,000-5,000 for a well maintained clean piece of equipment.  An inferior dirty piece of equipment may be similar to a shop vac and should never be used for air duct cleaning.  Portable air duct cleaning equipment is by far the most common due to the low cost.  It is worth noting that not all portable equipment is the same but properly maintained portable vacuums designed for air duct cleaning can do the trick but they may loose a lot of their suction power once a cleaning begins because the filters may get dirty and clogged.  There is a range in quality and suction power of portable air duct cleaning equipment.  If you choose to have your air ducts cleaned by a company that you feel will provide the best value for your money, make sure that if portable equipment is used it is HEPA filtered.  The reason for this is that if there is not the proper filtration on the vacuum, when it is on and exhausting air into your home or business it could also be contaminating the air you breath.  HEPA filters will collect and catch almost all debris if clean and maintained and stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Arresting or High-Efficiency Particulate Air and can capture 99.97% of all debris greater than .3 microns.<br/>
        <br/>
        When an air duct cleaning company comes to clean an air duct system it is important to remember that all pieces of the air delivery system (air ducts) must be cleaned to provide you with results.  Air duct systems can accumulate 20-30 pounds of debris that is being spewed into the living space when the furnace or air conditioner is running.  In many cases, after a proper air duct cleaning, our clients at Amistee  notice less dust indoor.If prior allergy or sinus problems were triggered while  being inside of the conditioned space reduced symptoms are noticed after an air  duct cleaning.<br/>
        <br/>
        Just like any industry, there are companies that will try and take advantage of consumers that are unaware of what to expect or what needs to be done for an air duct cleaning.  These unethical companies have been giving the air duct cleaning industry a bad name for many years and if I got my air ducts cleaned at my personal residence by one of these companies I too would think it is not worth the money.  The truth is, when done right air duct cleaning really works.  Air duct cleaning removes the debris from the interior surfaces which you will someday be breathing. When searching for an air duct cleaning company if the deal seems too good to be true, it usually is!  Maybe you are allergic to the debris or maybe you are not, this does not change the fact that the debris is there and you will be breathing it if not properly removed by a proper air duct cleaning.<br/>
        <br/>
        When choosing an air duct cleaning company to clean your air ducts, do  your research. The best way when choosing a company is to look at a companies  history with past clients and ask for recent jobs that have been done. If they  do good work, they are proud of the work they do and would be happy to have you  speak with recent customers. Do they have any complaints on the BBB? Ask the  potential company for referrals from past customers in your area or for  customers that have a similar air duct configurations if yours is unique. Check  the length of time the business has been cleaning air ducts. Is it an add on  service? Make sure the potential company is licensed and insured and ask to see  both of these (there is nothing wrong with asking, if they have both they will  easily provide them to you). Do other service companies refer the potential air  duct cleaner? If so, ask who and call them to see the history. You can tell a  lot about someone by their friends and the same goes for businesses. Lastly,  make sure the price they are quoting you will not change and if so why. Do not  fall victim to a &quot;bait and switch&quot; scam.)<br/>
